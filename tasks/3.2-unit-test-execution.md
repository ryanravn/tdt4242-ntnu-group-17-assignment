Task 3.2. Unit test execution
Description
In this task, you will move from test design to test implementation. Using your existing codebase, you will implement executable unit tests, with optional assistance from AI-based development tools. The objective is to achieve high structural test coverage, specifically: Line coverage: ≥ 60% Branch coverage: ≥ 70% Function/method coverage: ≥ 80% You must write or generate real, runnable unit tests that target critical functions and logic in the system. The test suite must execute locally without errors, produce reproducible coverage results, and demonstrate meaningful testing of edge cases and branch conditions.

Outcome
1. Executable test files committed to your GitHub repository. Tests stored under /tests/ or /src/tests/ Tests must include assertions, setup/teardown where relevant, mocks or stubs, edge-case coverage, and explicit branch testing 2. Coverage report, generated by running: npm run test -- --coverage Include: Screenshot(s) of the HTML coverage report Visible line, branch, and function statistics

Evaluation Criteria
Achievement of coverage targets: Test suites meet or exceed the specified line, branch, and function coverage thresholds Quality of unit tests: Tests are deterministic, maintainable, clearly structured, and focused on behaviour rather than implementation details
