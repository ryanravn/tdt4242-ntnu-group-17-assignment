# Task 3.4 - Responsible AI Use Reflection

## Description

In this task, you will produce a structured reflection on your use of AI tools throughout the entire software development lifecycle of the project. The reflection should demonstrate critical thinking, technical understanding, and awareness of how AI influenced both process and professional judgement.

Your reflection must address the following phases:

1. **Requirements Elicitation with AI vs. Human Stakeholders** - Reflect on your experience using the iRE Agent compared to interviewing a real human stakeholder. Discuss differences in depth, clarity, assumptions, follow-up questioning, and limitations of each approach.

2. **Using AI to Understand Web Development Concepts** - Explain how AI tools supported (or failed to support) your understanding of web development concepts, architectures, or frameworks. Include examples where AI helped clarify concepts or where independent validation was required.

3. **AI-Assisted Code Generation Process** - Describe how you used AI tools to generate code, including prompting strategies, iteration patterns, and how requirements were translated into prompts.

4. **Revision and Correction of AI-Generated Code** - Analyse how and why you modified AI-generated code. Discuss typical issues encountered (e.g. logic errors, missing edge cases, architectural weaknesses) and explain your reasoning when fixing or refactoring the code.

5. **Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Code** - Evaluate the overall quality of AI-generated code in terms of correctness, readability, structure, maintainability, and alignment with requirements.

6. **Best Practices Developed When Working with AI** - Identify the working practices you found most effective when using AI in this project, such as trial-and-error learning, analogy-based prompting, guided reasoning, stepwise refinement, or rapid feedback loops. Explain why these practices worked.

7. **Professional Identity and Way of Working** - Reflect on how working with AI affected your role as an engineer. Did AI increase or reduce your sense of responsibility, confidence, or judgement? Discuss whether AI supported deeper engineering thinking or encouraged superficial solutions.

## Expected Outcome

1. **Attached AI Interaction Log (Mandatory Attachment)** - A chronological record of AI usage including: prompts submitted, responses received, short notes on why prompts were changed, evidence of refinement process.

2. **Reflection text** (max 800 words)

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Comprehensiveness of the AI Log:** The AI interaction log is complete, chronological, and covers all significant prompts, responses, refinements, and rationale.
- **Depth of Reflection:** The reflection critically analyses how AI are used for development and learning.
- **Transparency and Traceability:** AI usage is fully documented, allowing clear tracing from prompts to decisions and final outcomes.
