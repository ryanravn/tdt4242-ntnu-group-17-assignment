# Task 2.1 - Prompting Strategy for Code Generation

## Description

Select one self-contained group of requirements (i.e. requirements that can be implemented independently from other groups) consisting of at least six (6) functional requirements and two (2) non-functional requirements. This group should represent a meaningful feature set of the system (for example, AI-usage logging or user authentication) and be suitable for isolated design and implementation.

**Example scope of the requirements:**

- *Functional requirement (user story):* As a student, I want to log how I used an AI tool for an assignment, so that my AI usage is documented and transparent.
- *Non-functional requirement (user story - usability):* As a student, I want the AI-usage logging interface to be simple and quick to use, so that logging does not interrupt my study workflow.

This task focuses on designing a structured prompting strategy for building components of the AIGuidebook website using AI-assisted code development tools (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or similar). NTNU provides GitHub Copilot licences for students, and the InnSpill platform offers free access; additional tools may require personal licences.

Using the requirements and dependency map from Task 1.3, you will design a systematic prompting approach that supports:

- Requirement-driven code generation
- Component-level architectural planning
- Iterative refinement and debugging
- Effective human-AI co-development

The goal is not to write code, but to define a repeatable prompting strategy that enables developers to reliably generate and validate React components aligned with real system requirements. Your strategy must demonstrate understanding of a full-stack web architecture, for example React for frontend, and Node.js + Express for backend.

## Expected Outcome

Prompt Strategy Document (maximum 500 words) describing a prompting approach and patterns used.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Quality of Prompt Strategy:** The strategy is coherent, repeatable, and covers known prompting patterns (at least 2).
- **Technical Understanding of full-stack web development:** Clear awareness of a full-stack web project structure, component organisation, and architectural concerns.
