Task 3.3. system test execution
Description
In this task, you will act as an independent QA team. You will receive a requirement list and a working codebase developed by another group, and your responsibility is to perform manual system-level testing to verify that the delivered software fully satisfies all specified requirements. Your objective is to achieve: 100% requirement coverage, meaning every requirement must be validated by at least one system test Complete and verifiable documentation of test results, so that outcomes are clear, reproducible, and auditable by a third party This task reflects real-world software delivery scenarios, where independent QA teams assess whether an external development team has met agreed contractual and functional requirements.

Outcome
System Test Table (Minimum one test per requirement) You must produce a structured test table including: | Test ID | Requirement ID | Test Scenario | Input/Steps | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail | Evidence (link/screenshot) |

Evaluation Criteria
Requirement Coverage Completeness: All requirements must be tested. Quality of System Test Design: Test scenarios are realistic, clearly defined, and appropriate for system-level validation rather than unit or integration testing. Documentation Quality: The system test table is complete, well-structured, and consistent in terminology and formatting. Requirement IDs, test IDs, and results are used correctly and consistently throughout the document.
