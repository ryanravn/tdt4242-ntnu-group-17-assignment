# Task 3.3 - System Test Execution

## Description

In this task, you will act as an independent QA team. You will receive a requirement list and a working codebase developed by another group, and your responsibility is to perform manual system-level testing to verify that the delivered software fully satisfies all specified requirements.

Your objective is to achieve:

- **100% requirement coverage**, meaning every requirement must be validated by at least one system test
- **Complete and verifiable documentation** of test results, so that outcomes are clear, reproducible, and auditable by a third party

This task reflects real-world software delivery scenarios, where independent QA teams assess whether an external development team has met agreed contractual and functional requirements.

## Expected Outcome

System Test Table (Minimum one test per requirement):

| Test ID | Requirement ID | Test Scenario | Input/Steps | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail | Evidence (link/screenshot) |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|---------------------------|

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Requirement Coverage Completeness:** All requirements must be tested.
- **Quality of System Test Design:** Test scenarios are realistic, clearly defined, and appropriate for system-level validation rather than unit or integration testing.
- **Documentation Quality:** The system test table is complete, well-structured, and consistent in terminology and formatting. Requirement IDs, test IDs, and results are used correctly and consistently throughout the document.
