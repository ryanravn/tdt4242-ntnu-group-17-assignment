# Task 3.1 - Test Plan

## Description

In this task, you will design a structured test suite for the AIGuidebook system that reflects professional quality-assurance (QA) practices. Your test set must include a balanced combination of unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and non-functional requirement (NFR) tests.

You will also define test coverage criteria for the system, including coverage of lines of code (LOC), branches/paths, and requirements. In addition, you must create a traceability matrix that links each requirement group selected from Task 2.1 to one or more test cases and, where possible, to specific implementation components.

## Expected Outcome

A test plan document including:

1. **Test Case Table** (cover all the given requirement group) using the following structure:

| Test ID | Test Type | Input / Trigger | Expected Output | Test Method | Pass/Fail Criteria | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------|

2. **Coverage Definition** briefly specifying coverage goals, for example:
   - LOC coverage (e.g. >= 65%)
   - Branch/path coverage (e.g. each conditional evaluated true and false)
   - Requirement coverage (100%)
   - NFR coverage (at least one test per NFR category, such as security or usability)

3. **Traceability Matrix** linking: Requirement -> Test Case(s) -> Implementation reference (file or component, if applicable)

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Breadth and depth of test coverage:** A well-balanced mix of unit, integration, system, and NFR tests that validates the full requirement set rather than isolated examples.
- **Technical correctness of test cases:** Each test clearly specifies inputs, actions, expected outcomes, and testing method or tool.
- **Professional use of traceability:** The traceability matrix clearly maps requirement IDs to concrete test cases, demonstrating complete requirement coverage.
- **Quality of coverage metrics:** Coverage goals are meaningful and justified (e.g. branch, line, requirement, and UI flow coverage), not merely listed.
