Task 3.1. Test plan
Description
In this task, you will design a structured test suite for the AIGuidebook system that reflects professional quality-assurance (QA) practices. Your test set must include a balanced combination of unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and non-functional requirement (NFR) tests. You will also define test coverage criteria for the system, including coverage of lines of code (LOC), branches/paths, and requirements. In addition, you must create a traceability matrix that links each requirement group selected from Task 2.1 to one or more test cases and, where possible, to specific implementation components.

Outcome
A test plan document including: Test Case Table (cover all the given requirement group) using the following structure: | Test ID | Test Type | Input / Trigger | Expected Output | Test Method | Pass/Fail Criteria | Notes | Coverage Definition briefly specifying coverage goals, for example: LOC coverage (e.g. ≥ 65%) Branch/path coverage (e.g. each conditional evaluated true and false) Requirement coverage (100%) NFR coverage (at least one test per NFR category, such as security or usability) Traceability Matrix linking: Requirement → Test Case(s) → Implementation reference (file or component, if applicable)

Evaluation Criteria
Breadth and depth of test coverage: A well-balanced mix of unit, integration, system, and NFR tests that validates the full requirement set rather than isolated examples. Technical correctness of test cases: Each test clearly specifies inputs, actions, expected outcomes, and testing method or tool. Professional use of traceability: The traceability matrix clearly maps requirement IDs to concrete test cases, demonstrating complete requirement coverage. Quality of coverage metrics: Coverage goals are meaningful and justified (e.g. branch, line, requirement, and UI flow coverage), not merely listed.
