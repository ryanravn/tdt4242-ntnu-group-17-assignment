# Project Overview

## Course Description

AI Guidebook for Students is a student-centred web application developed to support everyday academic work in an era where generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Claude are increasingly embedded in study practices. As students adopt AI tools rapidly, there is a growing need for clear guidance that helps them use AI responsibly, transparently, and in alignment with institutional academic integrity policies. The AI Guidebook provides a structured environment where students can reflect on, document, and manage their AI use while remaining compliant with university-level ethical and academic standards. Functionally, the system shall offer AI usage logging, assignment-level AI declarations, ethical guidelines, and automated compliance checks against institutional rules (e.g., NTNU), combined with a personal dashboard that visualizes usage patterns over time. From a non-functional perspective, the application emphasizes transparency, explainability, privacy-aware data handling, and usability, ensuring that AI support strengthens learning rather than replacing student responsibility.

## Learning Outcome

1. Identifisere og korrigere typiske krav kvalitetsproblemer
2. Bruke forskjellige test, kodevurdering, kodeanalyse, og kode refactoring strategier
3. Forklare industristandard praksis metoder av avansert programvareutvikling
4. Kritisk evaluering og bruk av KI-assisterte programvareutviklingverktøy
