# Task 1.3 - Requirement Dependency Analysis and Categorization

## Description

Using the requirements set from Task 1.1, you will perform a dependency and categorization analysis for the AIGuidebook system. You will:

- Identify technical, functional, and business dependencies between requirements
- Categorise requirements into logical clusters (e.g., data, UI, business logic, security, integration)
- Detect "chains" of requirements (what must come first, what is enabled or refined by others)
- Classify requirements as critical, optional, or derived

The purpose is to understand how requirements interact, how changes propagate through the system, and how the overall dependency structure will affect planning, architecture, and implementation order.

## Expected Outcome

1. A JSON file describing all the dependencies among requirements: `depends_on`, `conflicts_with`, `enables`, `refines`, `duplicates`, and `overlap`.
2. A paragraph to describe how these dependencies affect implementation order (max 300 words).

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correct Identification of Dependencies:** The student must correctly identify and label meaningful relationships between requirements based on logical, technical, and business reasoning.
- **Logical and Coherent Categorization:** Requirements must be grouped into clear, meaningful clusters that reflect system structure, not arbitrary or convenience-based grouping.
- **Quality of JSON Dependency Model:** The JSON representation must be syntactically valid, structurally consistent, and complete enough to be usable as a basis for design, planning, or tooling.
- **Quality of Reasoning about Impact on Implementation:** The explanatory paragraph must clearly describe how dependency structure influences implementation order, risk, and planning.

### Requirements

**Non-functional requirements:**

1. As a user of the AI Guidebook, I want to log AI usage in under 2 seconds, so that there is a smooth user engagement.
2. As a user of the AI Guidebook, I want the software to reply to the student's message in under 30 seconds, so that it can be competitive among other products.
3. As a user of the AI Guidebook, I want the software to be available 99.9% of the time.

**Functional requirements:**

#### Guidance & Policy

- **RE-01:** As a student, I want to access a static page of institutional AI guidelines so that I can review rules at any time.
- **RE-02:** As a student, I want to see contextual guideline prompts during logging so that I am reminded of rules at relevant decision points.
- **RE-03:** As an administrator, I want to require students to acknowledge AI guidelines before they proceed to submission to ensure explicit compliance.
- **RE-04:** As a student, I want the system to explain if a specific action (e.g., paraphrasing) is allowed so that I do not accidentally violate integrity policies.

#### Intelligent Scaffolding

- **RE-05:** As an administrator, I want the system to detect when an assignment question is pasted into the chat to trigger integrity protocols.
- **RE-06:** As a student, I want the system to block direct answer generation for pasted questions to preserve academic integrity.
- **RE-07:** As a student, I want structured reflective prompts when a question is detected to help me break down the problem manually.
- **RE-08:** As a student, I want the system to suggest relevant academic resources or frameworks to support independent problem-solving.

#### Logging & Transparency

- **RE-09:** As a student, I want to log AI usage sessions in real-time using quick-input checkboxes (e.g., task types) to minimize workflow friction.
- **RE-10:** As a student, I want to link each log entry to a specific assignment or course activity for accurate record-keeping.
- **RE-11:** As a student, I want to declare tools used and the nature of AI assistance at the point of submission for full transparency.
- **RE-12:** As a student, I want to view my own usage history to reflect on my level of AI reliance over time.

#### Risk Engine

- **RE-13:** As an administrator, I want the system to classify usage into Low, Medium, and High risk based on task type and frequency.
- **RE-14:** As an administrator, I want to compare student declarations with logged data to detect reporting discrepancies automatically.
- **RE-15:** As an administrator, I want the system to perform a formal risk classification exactly at the time of assignment submission.
- **RE-16:** As an administrator, I want the system to alert academic advisors when a student is classified as "High Risk" for immediate follow-up.

#### Feedback & Privacy

- **RE-17:** As a student, I want a summary of my risk status with tips for improvement so that I can build better AI habits.
- **RE-18:** As a student, I want to complete a mandatory review of AI practices if my usage is High Risk to ensure I understand the implications.
- **RE-19:** As a student, I want my identity to be anonymized in aggregated institutional reports to protect my privacy.
- **RE-20:** As an administrator, I want to view aggregated statistics on tool usage trends to improve institutional academic practices.

### Implementation Order Analysis

The dependency graph implies an implementation order that starts with foundational constraints and data capture, then builds up to risk logic and higher-level workflows. First, establish availability and resilience requirements (NFR-03), since most core features are enabled by it and failures would block policy access, logging, and submission support. Next, implement performance/usability constraints (NFR-01, NFR-02) early because they shape UI responsiveness and the feasibility of real-time checks during student workflows. With foundations in place, deliver the policy baseline and guidance components (RE-01 -> RE-02 -> RE-03 -> RE-04) so the system can present rules and compliance expectations consistently. In parallel, implement the activity logging and data capture backbone (RE-09, RE-10), because dashboards (RE-12), declarations (RE-11), and risk detection all rely on recorded interaction data. After logging exists, build the risk and decision chain (RE-13, RE-14), which then enables submission-time checks and workflow gating (RE-15, RE-16) and remediation (RE-18). Finally, implement the higher-level outcomes and reporting/insight features (RE-17, RE-19, RE-20), since they depend on earlier logging and risk evaluation outputs. Duplicate and overlap links (e.g., RE-09/RE-10, RE-11/RE-12) indicate opportunities to merge or modularize features to reduce rework. Overall, the graph supports an incremental delivery plan: foundations -> policy UI -> logging -> risk engine -> workflow enforcement -> analytics/feedback.

## Feedback

> **Score: 4/5**

Good structure and nice clustering in the text, but the graph logic is somewhat inconsistent.

**Clustering and prioritization:** OK!

**Issues identified:**

- **Risk engine depends on detection only (wrong):**
  - RE-13 `depends_on` RE-05 only
  - RE-14 `depends_on` RE-05 only
  - But risk classification and declaration-vs-log discrepancy need data: logging (RE-09, RE-10) and declarations (RE-11) for RE-14

- **Several "enables" are backwards (wrong direction):**
  - RE-13 enables RE-09 and RE-10 (reverse)
  - RE-14 enables RE-09 (reverse)
  - RE-15 enables RE-09 (reverse)
  - RE-16 enables RE-09 (reverse)

- **Logging dependencies are missing:**
  - RE-09 `depends_on` [] and RE-10 `depends_on` []
  - But they should at least depend on authentication / assignment list (not included here)
