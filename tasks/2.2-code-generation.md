Task 2.2. Code generation
Description
Use ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, or similar AI tools to generate a full-stack web application that implements the requirements selected from Exercise 2.1. Following your defined prompting strategy and requirement set, you will guide an AI code assistant to generate the initial version of the system. Look at a mock-up below as an inspiration: Your objective is to deliver: Correct installation and configuration of all required libraries and dependencies Revision of AI-generated code if needed A working full stack web application that runs locally in your computer A clear and complete explanation of the codebase structure and design decisions

Outcome
A document including: Link to a public GitHub repository containing the full project Screenshots demonstrating successful execution Explanation of the role of each major component What code was generated by AI and what was written or modified by you

Evaluation Criteria
Successful Code Execution: The code must run without errors in your local environment and meet the functional scope agreed. Quality of reflection: Students must clearly explain architecture, component purpose, state management choices, and division between AI-produced and student-written code.
